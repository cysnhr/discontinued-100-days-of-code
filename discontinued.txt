I've lost the momentum long ago, and the challenge seeked consecutive, continuous dedication, which I could not afford at the moment. 
To excel at academics I must focus, and the guilt accompanying missing a day in the challenge is distracting and, frankly, feels terrible. This probably wasn't what the challenge aimed at in the first place.
I'd rather make programming a hobby than a task, and discontinuing the challenge does not mean I'll stop learning. It'll just be less consecutive but I'm still going to be here!
Next step: understand merge sort.
