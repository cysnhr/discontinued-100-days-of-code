I figured [this project](./codingpractices/probability_calculator.py) is a little out of my league (?) and requires more research. A friend told me to look up polymorphism in python, whatever that is, and there are also some things I should catch up on. For instance, `**kwargs`, because I didn't even know it existed.

Wonderful. I'm not really sure I got it, but I think it has something to do with reusing functions.

Okay, I'm half right. It's a concept, really, for example the built-in len() function that works with all kinds of data types.

Thank you programiz and geeksforgeeks. 

What does this have to do with the project I wonder.

Anyways, I also have to figure out why the `copy` module was imported, what it has to do with this code. I've never heard of it either :/
