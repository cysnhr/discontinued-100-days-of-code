# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Came across LeetCode and did one question before bed.

**Thoughts:** I keep making dumb mistakes like messing up variable names or forgetting commas. I don't know why I rely on for loops so much, to the extent of implementing a double for loop here. I wish as I go further into these 100 days I'd stop doing it. Even though it doesn't really matter that much right now because the list is short.
an alternative for linear search is `if (something) in (something)`
