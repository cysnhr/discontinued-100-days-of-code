# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Came across LeetCode and did one question before bed.

**Thoughts:** I keep making dumb mistakes like messing up variable names or forgetting commas. I don't know why I rely on for loops so much, to the extent of implementing a double for loop here. I wish as I go further into these 100 days I'd stop doing it. Even though it doesn't really matter that much right now because the list is short.
an alternative for linear search is `if (something) in (something)`

### Day 2: Jan 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Got stumped on data structures. Arghh it's a mess and me coding for one hour basically consists of 5 minutes staring at the question 5 minutes writing code 50 minutes figuring out what dumb mistake I made. 

**Thoughts:** Today I tried to code a linked list problem (see below) but I don't think I really get what they're about. Even after staring at the solutions other people are offering. I need to actually learn linked lists. Fortunately I found a great source which is Coderbyte but I still have so much homework I haven't finished.

### Day 3: Jan 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learned about linked lists on [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/video/the-basics-of-linked-lists). Wrote code for CS50 Problem Set 1 but is missing one tiny part where I can't identify Mastercards. Will probably finish it off tomorrow.
(update 1hr later) YESSS I FINISHED IT they're little mistakes that I'm going to comment in the [code section](credit.c).

**Thoughts:** I wrote something which is better than nothing...? Also coding while eating dinner is probably not so good for digestion because I felt and it's not because of the constant errors. But all this took wayyy too much time, like, I just forget time passing when I'm writing this, and I need to manage my time better--should try the pomodoro technique.
