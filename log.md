# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Came across LeetCode and did one question before bed.

**Thoughts:** I keep making dumb mistakes like messing up variable names or forgetting commas. I don't know why I rely on for loops so much, to the extent of implementing a double for loop here. I wish as I go further into these 100 days I'd stop doing it. Even though it doesn't really matter that much right now because the list is short.
an alternative for linear search is `if (something) in (something)`

### Day 2: Jan 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Got stumped on data structures. Arghh it's a mess and me coding for one hour basically consists of 5 minutes staring at the question 5 minutes writing code 50 minutes figuring out what dumb mistake I made. 

**Thoughts:** Today I tried to code a linked list problem (see below) but I don't think I really get what they're about. Even after staring at the solutions other people are offering. I need to actually learn linked lists. Fortunately I found a great source which is Coderbyte but I still have so much homework I haven't finished.

### Day 3: Jan 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learned about linked lists on [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/video/the-basics-of-linked-lists). Wrote code for CS50 Problem Set 1 but is missing one tiny part where I can't identify Mastercards. Will probably finish it off tomorrow.
(update 1hr later) YESSS I FINISHED IT they're little mistakes that I'm going to comment in the [code section](./codingpractices/credit.c).

**Thoughts:** I wrote something which is better than nothing...? Also coding while eating dinner is probably not so good for digestion because I felt and it's not because of the constant errors. But all this took wayyy too much time, like, I just forget time passing when I'm writing this, and I need to manage my time better--should try the pomodoro technique.

### Day 4: Jan 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished another assignment from CS50 -- [readability](./codingpractices/credit.c). 

**Thoughts:** I made less stupid mistakes today and timed myself. Honestly, before starting this challenge I thought coding for an hour was difficult to excede, but how I'm wrong. It makes me forget time :) I know it's probably easier but I felt better after coding this. Okay I'll start to learn about linked lists again tomorrow.

### Day 5: Jan 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Eek I was trying to code linked lists but things aren't really working out that well. I don't know why they're only giving me memory addresses and forgot to create a list instance first which led to a lot of wasted time. But I did find out more about linked lists which is pretty nice.

**Thoughts:** I have coded for more than two hours and I figured it is the effort that counts, and I need to go study now. Let's see if I'll come to some grand realization tomorrow.

### Day 6: Jan 6, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Gosh I just found out how objects really worked. Still haven't figured out why that linked list keeps passing in NoneTypes so frankly not a great deal of progress today.

```
>>> class Random:
      def __init__(self, value):
          self.value = value

        
>>> Random(24)
output: <__main__.Random object at 0x103d91f30>

>>> Random(24).value
output: 24
```
When you ask for an object, it only gives you an address. I felt foolish for not knowing this but I'm glad I do now.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting frustrated with myself and I need to force myself to code only during a certain time. Also I asked a lot of people but they didn't know either so. I guess. I'm not exactly alone in the world.

**Link to work:** err, no work? just a nice fun day of failed debugging. Also I tried looking up other people's 100 days of code log but it looks like I'm the only one with this much useless stuff to talk about.
